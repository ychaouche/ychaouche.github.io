** lnav
*** why I don't like
**** filters
you can't use filter-in and filter-out at the same time.
Try this :
filter-in postfix
filter-out anvil

anvil still displayed

try other way around, anvil still displayed.
**** sql queries
when you edit a query
backspace deletes more than just a character,
it seems to delete everything before point
*** why I like
it's like logstash or splunk at a smaller scale,
but contrary to both,
it is easy to install,
has no setup required,
and don't require to run on their own server
(easy on resources)
*** automatic completions
C-g
*** moving around
o/O 	      forward/backward 1h
d/D 	      forward/backward 1D
1-6/Shift 1-6 forward/backward hour + 10-60 minutes -backrwards doesn't work in azerty layout-
0/Shift 0     next/previous day boundary
home/end      top/bottom of file
s/S	      previous/next [s]lowdown (log rate drops)


e/E           next/previous error
w/W           next/previous warning

f/F           next/previous file
*** searching
**** string search
n/N next/previous search hit
<>  next/previous search hit on same line
some words and values avaiable in the logs are auto-completable with <tab>
**** sql search
sqlite tables are created on the fly to search for things.
type p to see the list of fields.
use with ;<sql>
*** display
**** marking lines and bookmarking
m       mark/unmarks a line
u/U     next/previous bookmarked line
C[lear] clear all bookmarks
**** Elapsed [T]ime
**** Histogram
i : toggle histogram
I : when in histogram view, pressing i will open log file at histogram position
z/Z : zoom in/out
**** filtering
:filter-in  	  : only show lines matching <filter>
:filter-out 	  : hide lines matching <filter>
:disable-filter   : <tab> completion available
:enable-filter    : <tab> completion available
:set-min-loglevel : <tab> completion available
**** word-wrap
:enable-word-wrap
:disable-word-wrap
**** follow
By default. Just go to EOF.
**** time frame
use :hide-lines-before and :hide-lines-after to only show lines between two time stamps
*** output
:append-to <file> : write marked lines to file
:pipe-to : write marked lines to a command
*** partitionning
the logfile can be partitionned with :partition-name
*** linuxquestion cheat-sheet
*** criticism
**** missing
disable all filters
view all filters
some filtering combination doesn't work, example : filter-in postifx, filter-out anvil, anvil isn't filtered out.
